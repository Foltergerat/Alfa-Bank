Enclosed:

5 month time period DNS logs showing artifacts of Russian Alfa Bank 
connections to mail1.Trump-Email.com. 

Trump-Email.com is confirmed to belong to the Trump Organization.
Follow the directions in trump-email.com.whois to verify this for yourself.

The host mail1.Trump-Email.com ONLY has traffic with Alfa Bank 
and Spectrum Health in a substantial pattern of human communication.

You can obtain a histogram of this data and run it for yourself on
your own computer by opening the file in this archive named all.html
or visiting http://gdd.i2p on the dark web. There
you can note the peaks and valleys which may be correlated to news 
and election cycle events. 

You can compare the log traffic patterns with studies of botnet and 
spam traffic patterns; this traffic is confirmed not to be botnet
or spam. You can study the special anomalous configuration of the 
mail server dedicated only to this purpose in these 5 months.

Consider most strongly what happened after the New York Times 
reporter asked ONLY Alfa Bank on Sept 21, what the connections 
are about:

 - Suddenly after 7 years of stable operation, Trump Organization
	orders their vendor CDCServices aka CenDyn.com - to make
	the host Trump-Email.com disappear

 - Why did TRUMP react when only ALFA was asked?

 - Trump Organization denies having any relationship of any kind
	with Alfa Bank and denies having any communications with 
	Alfa Bank

 - Why was the zone file for Trump-Email.com removed from the three
	CDCServices.com authoritative name servers at about 9:50am
	Eastern US time on Sept 23rd? (Removed from configuration 
	files for ns1 and ns3; just delete A record from ns2. You 
	can still test this for yourself today.)

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE:

 - CDCServices aka CenDyn (Trump's CRM vendor) creates a replacement 
	hostname pointing to the same IP mail1.Trump-Email.com had
	pointed to. 

 - This new host is named trump1.contact-client.com.

 - The first company to look up the new Trump1 host? Alfa Bank from
	the same Russian IP space that communicated for 5 months
	with mail1.Trump-Email.com!

(The more recent details may only be available at http://gdd.i2p)

Who are the companies that play a role in this saga?

 - The Trump Organization is the owner of the domain Trump-Email.com
	and gives orders to vendors how to configure servers for Trump 
	Organization use and when to add or remove hosts.

 - Listrak.com: Vendors to Trump. Listrak.com maintains the physical
	server the mail1.Trump-Email.com and trump1.contact-client.com
	hostnames pointed to. 

 - CDCServices aka CenDyn.com: Vendors to Trump. CenDyn provides CRM 
	(Customer Relationship Management) marketing, "one-to-one" email
	communications specializing in the hospitality industry. 
	CDCServices operates the authoritative name service for the 
	Trump-Email.com domain name which is owned by the Trump Organization
	as well as the Contact-Client.com domain which is owned by CenDyn.

 - Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia with massive assets, very 
	close ties to the Kremlin, recent "investments" in America and a
	stated interest (Bloomberg) in investing 2 billion $ in US health
	care businesses

 - Spectrum Health, a US health care business in Michigan also with
	substantial donor relationships with the Devos family, founders 
	of Amway / Alticor which also operates in Russia. The Devos 
	family has a member who founded Blackwater and the Devos family
	has recently given millions (see FEC.gov) to Koch Brothers and 
	Karl Rove super PACs.
